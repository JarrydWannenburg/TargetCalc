# TargetCalc
A repository for LightingCalc for the LAMP Project which can be found online here (https://uga-lighting-calc.shinyapps.io/lightingcalc/)

Similar to the ‘Unlimited lighting calculator’, but taking the opposite approach: users specify the capacity of their lighting system, and the calculator will estimate on how many days of the year you can reach your target DLI. The associated electricity costs and demand charge are estimated as well. This calculator is particularly useful for determining how well an existing lighting system meets your needs.
